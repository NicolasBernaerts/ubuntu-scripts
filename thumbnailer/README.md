You'll find here some Thumbnailers I've made for various file formats :
  * Libre Office
  * Ms Office
  * GIMP
  * Graphviz
  * RAW pictures

They should work under Ubuntu, Debian and Linux Mint.

They may not be the official ones, but they do the job as I expect it to be done (graphical preview, fast rendering, ...).

Feel free to adapt them for other distributions or file managers. And let me know !
